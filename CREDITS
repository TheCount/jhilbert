GHilbert
========
JHilbert started as an implementation of GHilbert by Raph Levien.
Unfortunately, as of September 2008, the GHilbert project appears to be on
standby. See

metamath
========
JHilbert is (as is GHilbert) inspired by metamath by Norman Megill.
Quote from the metamath website:
"Metamath is a tiny language that can express theorems in abstract mathematics,
accompanied by proofs that can be verified by a computer program."
Metamath is accompanied by a large database of theorems, based on ZFC set
theory or quantum logic. See
