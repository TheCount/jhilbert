These are the build instructions for JHilbert.

Prerequisites
=============
You'll need the Apache Maven 2 project builder (version 2.0.7 works), see
http://maven.apache.org/. You'll also need a Java Development Kit (JDK)
compatible with Maven which supports Java Generics (Sun JDK 1.5.0_14 works).

Building
========
In the project's root directory (that's the directory with the pom.xml file
in it), run
	mvn package
and a ready-to-use JAR file will be generated in the target/ subdirectory.
Note that maven will pull in many dependencies automatically from the internet
when you run it for the first time. You can also generate site documentation
in target/site/ by running
	mvn site
The site documentation is still *very* sparse (as of June 2008).
