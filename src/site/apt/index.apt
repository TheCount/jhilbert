 JHilbert is a verifier for collaborative theorem proving.

 JHilbert can be run as a standalone application. However, it is meant to be
integrated with {{{http://www.mediawiki.org}MediaWiki}} with a specialized
extension.

 <<Important notice:>> Please update to version 6. Versions 4, 5, and perhaps
earlier versions have a bug which caused the consequent equality checker to
ignore non-dummy variables, leading to possibly wrong conclusions in theorems
with hypotheses. Theorems without hypotheses are not affected.
