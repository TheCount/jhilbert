 JHilbert is a verifier for collaborative theorem proving.

 JHilbert can be run as a standalone application. However, it was written
to drive {{{http://www.wikiproofs.de}}}, a Wiki project dedicated to creating
a free repository of instantly verified proofs.

 <<Important notice:>> Please update to version 7. Version 6 and perhaps
earlier versions have a bug where the exported definition checker would be
called at an inappropriate time, rendering it ineffective.
