 JHilbert is a verifier for collaborative theorem proving.

 JHilbert can be run as a standalone application. However, it was written
to drive {{{http://www.wikiproofs.de}Wikiproofs}}, a Wiki project dedicated to
creating a free repository of instantly verified proofs.

 <<Important notice:>> Please update to version 9. Version 8 has some bugs in
the verifier DV constraint/expression matching code. Given the new soundness
proof at
{{http://www.wikiproofs.de/w/index.php?title=Wikiproofs:JHilbert definition soundness}},
the current code appears to be quite a mess. The next version will have a much
more sophisticated expression parser. I'll take that chance to clean up the
code on the way.
