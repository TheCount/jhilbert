 JHilbert is a verifier for collaborative theorem proving.

 JHilbert can be run as a standalone application. However, it was written
to drive {{{http://www.wikiproofs.de}Wikiproofs}}, a Wiki project dedicated to
creating a free repository of instantly verified proofs.

 <<Important notice:>> Please update to version 8. Version 7 and perhaps
earlier versions have serious bugs in the consequent/proof result comparison
code.
