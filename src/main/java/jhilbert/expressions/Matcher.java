 * {@link Variable}/{@link Variable} comparisons. For
 * {@link Variable}/{@link Expression} comparisons, use a {@link Substituter}.
 * <p>
 * <code>Matcher</code> currently supports two notions of equality:
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>Definition equivalence:</strong> When source and target
 * 	expression are unfolded to
 * 	{@link jhilbert.data.Functor#definitionDepth} zero, they are equal,
 * 	with no substitutions necessary whatsoever.
 * <li><strong>Variable equivalence:</strong> When source and target expression
 * 	can be made <em>definition equivalent</em> with a well-formed
 * 	translation of dummy variables. In order to avoid unsound replacement
 * 	of dummy variables with non-dummies, a blacklist of
 * 	not-to-dummy-assignable variables may be specified, causing an
 * 	exception to be thrown if such an assignment would be necessary.
 * </ol>
 * A single matcher can be used several times for simultaneous well-formed
 * matching.
