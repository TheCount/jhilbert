<strong>Warning:</strong> The {@link jhilbert.data.impl.AbstractName#equals}
and {@link jhilbert.data.impl.AbstractName#hashCode} fulfill the contract
specified in {@link java.lang.Object} only if the
{@link jhilbert.data.impl.NamespaceImpl#identify} method has not been used
before on the instances involved. In JHilbert, the
{@link jhilbert.data.impl.NamespaceImpl#identify} method is only ever used on
{@link jhilbert.data.impl.KindImpl}. Normally you'd use a
{@link jhilbert.data.impl.NamespaceImpl} instance instead of the java
collections framework to circumvent problems arising from the contract
violation. If you don't, make sure you use {@link java.util.IdentityHashMap} or
{@link jhilbert.utils.IdentityHashSet} when using
{@link jhilbert.data.impl.KindImpl} instances as keys or elements.
